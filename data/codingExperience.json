[{"Coding Experience":"As a student majoring in Informatics I have a diverse coding background. Using Java, I completed various small projects ranging from a program that automatically scans large sequences of HTML code and validates whether the code will be successfully executed, to a Huffman Encoder. I performed Linear Algebra and Vector Calculus operations, made 3D models, and carried out basic statistical analysis with MATLAB. During my undergraduate research, I used VisualDSD, a design and analysis tool made for programming and simulating DNA circuits, to model Strand Displacement Amplification cascade experiments. I’ve frequently targeted and modified specific sequences. As part of my INFO 343 coursework, I’m learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJs, and D3.js. I also strive to continually and fervently learn new things outside of school; I am teaching myself Perl by doing a few small outside projects inspired by Learn Perl the Hard Way, and becoming acquainted with Machine Learning and other important algorithms through other books."}]
